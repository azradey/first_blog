Hi! My name is Abigail Radey, welcome to my blog! I'm from downtown Manhattan and I go to Tufts University outside Boston. At Tufts, I'm a rising sophomore studying Human Factors Engineering and Economics. I really love my university and all the people I've met there this past year. When I left Tufts in May, I was pretty nervous about not seeing my friends for the whole summer and having to make new friends in Cape Town. However, I've met so many great people at iXperience and have had such a great time in Cape Town. This program, this city, and all the people I've met have exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier about it.
